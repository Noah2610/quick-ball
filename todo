	bugs:
		x player ring size doesn't shrink when hit,
		x		player ring size only updates when player moves
		x player canvas edge boundaries
		x on player death, remove its vertices and inCollision objects

	plans:
		proper win condition / respawn
		upgrade pickups
		change action key to a keydown event
